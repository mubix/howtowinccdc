#### How to apply

Email or DM @mubix two months prior to the first qualifying round asking to be on the team.
If you have any prior blue team experience you should mention that. If accepted, you will be
added to a Google Group. This is the announcements channels where upates come in.

#### What to expect

The MACCDC Red Team is broken up into four different teams: Linux, Web, Windows, and Team Focus.
The Team Focus team ensures that each competiting team gets the same amount of love and takes
attacks and shells the parts of the red team are using and makes sure that the same attacks 
are done against every team. Qualifiers are a qualifying event for Red Teamers too. No matter
how long you have been with the team, the Red Team that is invited to finals is the team leads
and core members of the Red Team elect to participate.

#### Red Team Rules

1. Respect will always be shown, every person apart of CCDC (blue, red, white, black, orange) is doing so in addition to their normal daily requirements, don't disrespect that sacrifice. It's ok to poke fun but never degrade. You will be removed from the Red Team permanently for doing so.
2. Similar to above, do not insult, discourage, or denigrate the students. For example, do not vandalize banners or websites with messages like 'BLUE TEAMS SUCK!'. Also, try to avoid obscenities and do not call out individuals i.e., ‘John Smith is an idiot’. 
3. We are not allowed to break any system or service in a non-trivial recoverable way until near the end of the competition. (Last 30 minutes of Qualifiers, Last half of the last day of Finals)
4. This event is a learning experience for the Blue Teams first and foremost. While learning can happen on the Red Team, that is not our mission, don't apply to the Red Team expecting mentorship. The Red Team is there to provide an adversarial simulation for the competition that can move and adapt like real adversaries.
5. Do not contact the students or respond to contact attempts from the students. If it happens, report it immediately. For Example, if a student finds your twitter handle in your malware, and sends you direct message, tell mubix immediately.
7. Be mindful of the underlying infrastructure. For Example, If we are operating against virtualized environments, do not execute ransomware that will drain lock up hypervisors hard drives (if you are unable to test this, do not do it). And do not execute a network-based DOS – especially when we all share a limited bandwidth connection. If you even suspect that you have caused an outage, report it immediately. 
9. If you are planting destructive malware (such as ransomeware, boo, nyan cat, floppy bird), only do so when given the order at the close of the competition. Do not plant it as a scheduled task or cronjob - it has gone off accidently too many times.

#### Blue Team Network Topology
The student networks differ year to year. Depending on the environment there may be more Linux, windows, or containers. You will be provided with an image containing the applications or images running in the student environments and their IP addresses (Ex. 192.168.x.14). Given this limited information it is safe to assume that if there are 10 teams competing in the competition then there will be a host with the IP address and the team number on the network. 

The blue teams objective is to keep the systems up and running and perform injects (tasks that require a bit of understanding of the network and applications) to gather points. The top 8 teams move onto the regional finals, and the top team at the regionals moves onto the nationals. Outside of being scored for the services, and the injects the students also have the ability to submit incident response reports describing the findings of malware, and other suspicious activities on their networks. If the students provide the proper information about the malware/activity they are able to block the malware through firewall rules.
